# convert-files
Basic scripts to convert outputs from DSSAT files to the AgMIP template

Code is based on a folder strucuture of code and data. On the *data* folder should be the required *.OUT files* and the *.csv* referring to the equivalence between DSSAT and AgMIP templates. The code must be on the *code* folder.

The only additional package on which the code relies is the 'zoo'.

Update from 2022: Should work, but I am not entirely sure. It may not work for when the simulation is interrupted for any reason.
