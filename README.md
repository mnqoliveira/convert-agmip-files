# convert-files
Basic scripts to convert outputs from DSSAT files to the AgMIP template

Code is based on a folder strucuture code and data. On the data folder should be the required .OUT files and the .csv referring to the equivalence between DSSAT and AgMIP templates.

The only additional package on which the code relies is the 'zoo'.
